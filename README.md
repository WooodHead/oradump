oradump
=======

A fast multi-threaded bulk downloader for Oracle queries written in C++11 style and designed to batch process numerous queries concurrently

###Why?
You can use sqlplus to do bulk downloads as csv files and spin multiple sessions.  

But you'll have to do extra work to get the column metadata.
You'll need that metadata when you need to create a destination table in another rdbms or a NoSQL like Cassandra.

Use oradump instead.

Comes with logging too.

###Usage
```
# oradump always expects ~ONE~ SQL statment per file

# Process one file
oradump --sid test --user scott -pass tiger --file /home/foo/some.sql

# Process entire directory
oradump --sid test --user scott -pass tiger --dir /home/foo/lotta-sql-path/
```
